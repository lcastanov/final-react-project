APP SET UP INSTRUCTIONS

- How to run locally: Type "npm install" then run Type "npx expo start" then run


COPILOT REFLECTION
- Copilot gave me a lot of issues but it also helped me a lot.
- Mainly it facilitated finding code, locating it.
- I used copilot the create the pie chart, there were multiple points in which it would suggest a change, I
would do it, but then it would break my app. I fixed this by going to previous versions of my code as even
if I asked Copilot to help me fix the issue, it would create even more issues.
- Copilot significantly sped up my work once again by finding code, I was able to change the version so that
it would automatically apply the suggestions it gave me rather than making me changing the code on by one.
